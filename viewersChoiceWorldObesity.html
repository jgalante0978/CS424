                <p>Raising awareness of the obesity epidemic is a noble cause which the World Obesity Federation is working to spread. By turning data into interesting graphics and interactable visualizations, the World Obesity Federation is creating simple ratios which people will understand.</p>

In contrast with regular Reminiscence Therapy, VRTU is cost effective as there is no need to build historical sets by hand or put money into building a scene. In addition to the time, money, and energy needed to build an "historical scene", the therapy may have no affect on the patient whatsoever. With all of this in mind, the VRTU app is a much more enticing alternative.</td>
